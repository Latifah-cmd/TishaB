#TISHA'S BOTIQUE WEBSITE
This project deals with developing a Virtual website ‘Tisha's Boutique Website’. 
It provides the user with a list of the various products available for purchase in the store.
For the convenience of online shopping, a shopping cart is provided to the user. After the selection of the goods,
it is sent for the order confirmation process. The system is implemented using Python's web framework Django.
